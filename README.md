# Scanny - A Python mass scanning tool
Scanny is a tool which can generate multiple IP addresses and scan them for open ports in a list. 
It is fast, effective and can also return info about the services behind the port. Scanny also has support for IP geolocation and ISP information.  

# Before using, read this
These kinds of tools are commonly misused and forked by bad actors, if you see this tool peforming any kinds  
of malicious activity please not only report it at your own accord but also keep in mind that this activity is  
nothing to do with me. I am simply releasing this on an educational basis and out of my own boredom, I am in no way  
liable for any source code edits/forks that are made to this application.

# Who is this for?
Good question, this is for people who may want to run their own services similar to Shodan,  
it also benefits researchers who want to know how many insecure devices are connected to the internet.
